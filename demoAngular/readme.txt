This demo application is to verify basic Angular functionality. 
They include: config, controller, directive, and filter and 
The parameter $scope passes between the HTML and Angular. 
The data array was per-defined in Angular.
The page layout is based on bootstrap3.
JQuery is only used in about page to handle the images and some others.  
So far, I only tested it in Visual Studio community 2015.
